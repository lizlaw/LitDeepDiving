# LitDeepDiving
Semi-automated rapid evidence mapping 
Presentation developed for an informal internal NINA presentation. 
Note the 'informal' - this is no polished repository, sorry.

This repository contains information for use of semi-automated literature search and analysis tools (using R). It includes worked examples for litsearchr, revtools, and scimeetr.

Data used in developing the presentation, and in the associated example R code files, is available through the OSF repository https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/3SDWC 

The presentation can be viewed by knitting the DeeperDivingSlides.Rmd. Or just reading through that file. 

Further code and examples are in the R folder. This includes some customised functions for use with scimeetr. 

Have fun :)
